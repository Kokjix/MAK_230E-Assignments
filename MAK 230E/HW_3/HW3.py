READ ME !!!!

This py file use OpenCV library for Image Processing therefore if you want to run this program you must install OpenCV on
python 3.6.10 on Anaconda root (base) environmant. Python 3.6.10 since OpenCV only run in this version. And also numpy and matplotlib must be
installed. All the picture are inside the img folder so if you want to run this program you must create folder named img and put all of the images inside that folder or
delete "img/" path from capture objects and put images same folder with this program.

This we make hard coding to make possible way to save image for blurrying
